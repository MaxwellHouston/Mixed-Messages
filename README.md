# Mixed Messages

## Info
Mixed Messages is a project for the full stack engineering course with Codecademy.
For this project I made my random message a type of *Mad-Lib*.
It takes a small story and inputs random Verbs, Adjectives, and other word types 
into areas marked for that type. Each time it should print out an unique and usually funny version of the story.

## Technical
All code is written in javascript. As of now, there are only 5 base stories. I have extensive lists of *verbs*, *adjectives*, *adverbs*, *nouns*, and *plural nouns*. These arrays are from @ijmacdowell on github which was a big help. The other arrays are much smaller and I put them together myself.
Any tips or observations are appreciated.

## Moving Forward
I don't have any plans to move forward with this project but feel free to use any code you like.
